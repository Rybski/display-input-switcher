# monitor-controller
App to control your monitors via app. For now it is hardcoded and crude

# Why?
Sometimes it is painfull to reach behind monitors to switch their source input. I always wanted to be able to use encoder to select active monitor and buttons to switch between inputs.

# TODO:
- Add GUI mouse/keyboard management apps style
- Add keybindings (select monitor, next/previous monitor from list, increase attribute, change input)
- ...
- Learn to code
